CocoaPods Deploy To Trunk:

# Deploying w/o the ability to include "--use-static-frameworks" eventually
# works but often with many failure attempts first. Running "pod repo update"
# immediately before appears to increase the chance of success.

pod repo update
pod trunk push gars-ios.podspec --swift-version=5
